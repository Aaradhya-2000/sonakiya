    </h1>
    <p className="testimonial-author">â€” In workplaces where there are potential hazards, both head and hand protection are crucial for safety. Proper head protection, such as hard hats, can prevent serious injuries from impacts and falling objects. Hand protection, like safety gloves, is essential to prevent cuts, burns, bruises, and other injuries from handling tools, materials, and machinery.</p>
