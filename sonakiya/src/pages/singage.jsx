    </h1>
    <p className="testimonial-author">â€” Safety signs and signage play a crucial role in workplace safety, and their effectiveness depends on factors like size, readability, and placement. Key measurements for safety signs include letter height, viewing distance, and sign placement to ensure they are easily seen and understood by workers. Regulations and standards like ANSI Z535.2-2011 and ISO 7010 provide guidance on these measurements.  </p>
